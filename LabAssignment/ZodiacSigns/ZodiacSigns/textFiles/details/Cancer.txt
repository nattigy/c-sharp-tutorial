Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac
signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about 
matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people 
they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very loyal and able to 
empathize with other people's pain and suffering.


The sign of Cancer belongs to the element of Water, just like Scorpio and Pisces. 
Guided by emotion and their heart, they could have a hard time blending into the 
world around them. Being ruled by the Moon, phases of the lunar cycle deepen their 
internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that are beyond their 
control. As children, they don't have enough coping and defensive mechanisms for 
the outer world, and have to be approached with care and understanding, for that is 
what they give in return.
