Capricorn is a sign that represents time and responsibility, and its representatives 
are traditional and often very serious by nature. These individuals possess an inner 
state of independence that enables significant progress both in their personal and 
professional lives. They are masters of self-control and have the ability to lead the 
way, make solid and realistic plans, and manage many people who work for them at any 
time. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the top based solely on their 
experience and expertise.


Belonging to the element of Earth , like Taurus and Virgo, this is the last sign in 
the trio of practicality and grounding. Not only do they focus on the material world, 
but they have the ability to use the most out of it. Unfortunately, this element also 
makes them stiff and sometimes too stubborn to move from one perspective or point in 
a relationship. They have a hard time accepting differences of other people that are 
too far from their character, and out of fear might try to impose their traditional 
values aggressively.


Saturn is the ruling planet of Capricorn, and this planet represents restrictions of 
all kinds. Its influence makes these people practical and responsible, but also cold, 
distant and unforgiving, prone to the feeling of guilt and turned to the past. They 
need to learn to forgive in order to make their own life lighter and more positive.
