Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of 
humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical 
approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often 
tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often 
misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they wonâ€™t 
accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason.
 The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling 
they are experiencing everything for the first time.


Virgo is an Earth sign, fitting perfectly between Taurus and Capricorn. This will 
lead to a strong character, but one that prefers conservative, well-organized things 
and a lot of practicality in their everyday life. These individuals have an organized
 life, and even when they let go to chaos, their goals and dreams still have strictly
 defined borders in their mind. Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will
 be impossible to fix, they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and 
concerned about matters that nobody else seems to care much about.


Since Mercury is the ruling planet of this sign, its representatives have a 
well-developed sense of speech and writing, as well as all other forms of communication
. Many Virgos may choose to pursue a career as writers, journalists, and typists, but
 their need to serve others makes them feel good as caregivers, on a clear mission to 
help.
