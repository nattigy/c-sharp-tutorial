Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and 
you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and
 ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless. 
They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling
 that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.


The sign of Gemini belongs to the element of Air, accompanying Libra and Aquarius, 
and this connects it to all aspects of the mind. It is ruled by Mercury, the planet 
that represents communication, writing, and movement. People born under this Sun 
sign often have a feeling that their other half is missing, so they are forever 
seeking new friends, mentors, colleagues and people to talk to.


Gemini's changeable and open mind makes them excellent artists, especially writers 
and journalists, and their skills and flexibility make them shine in trade, driving 
and team sports. This is a versatile, inquisitive, fun loving sign, born with a wish 
to experience everything there is out there, in the world. This makes their character 
inspiring, and never boring.
