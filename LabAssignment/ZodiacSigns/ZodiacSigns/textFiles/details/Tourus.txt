Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits of labor. 
They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material 
world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with their Sun in Taurus are 
sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most important of all senses. 
Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, ready 
to endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal 
satisfaction.


Taurus is an Earth sign, just like Virgo and Capricorn, and has the ability
 to see things from a grounded, practical and realistic perspective. 
They find it easy to make money and stay on same projects for years, 
or until they are completed. What we often see as stubbornness can be 
interpreted as commitment, and their ability to complete tasks whatever 
it takes is uncanny. This makes them excellent employees, great long-term 
friends and partners, always being there for people they love. Earthly note
 makes them overprotective, conservative, or materialistic at times, with 
views of the world founded on their love of money and wealth.
