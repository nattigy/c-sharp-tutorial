People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative
, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything
 they want to in any area of life they commit to. There is a specific strength to a 
Leo and their "king of the jungle" status. Leo often has many friends for they are 
generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of 
uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, 
and their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.


Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like Aries and Sagittarius. This makes them 
warmhearted, in love with life, trying to laugh and have a good time. Able to use 
their mind to solve even the most difficult problems, they will easily take initiative 
in resolving various complicated situations. Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships this fiery 
entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in search for 
self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality,
 they can easily ask for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously
 neglect the needs of other people in their chase for personal gain or status. 
When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and 
the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.
