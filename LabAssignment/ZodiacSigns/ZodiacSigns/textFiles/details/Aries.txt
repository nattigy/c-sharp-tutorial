As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the 
beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking 
for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from 
work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it 
belongs to the element of Fire (just like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of 
the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before 
they think about it well.


The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills, so you'll 
rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often 
before lunch break! Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and 
vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born under this sign 
have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through 
this incarnation.
